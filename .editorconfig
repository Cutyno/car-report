# EditorConfig is awesome: https://EditorConfig.org

# EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding
# styles between different editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project
# consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection
# of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format
# and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable
# and they work nicely with version control systems.
